# Cloudinary Build Error Fix

## Problem
When running `npm run build`, the following errors occurred:
```
Module not found: Can't resolve 'cloudinary'
```
This affected multiple files:
- `/src/app/api/admin/upload/multiple/route.js`
- `/src/app/api/admin/upload/route.js`
- `/src/lib/cloudinary.js`

## Root Cause
The `cloudinary` npm package was not installed in the project, even though the code was trying to import it.

## Solution
Installed the missing `cloudinary` package:
```bash
npm install cloudinary
```

## Verification
After installation, the build process completed successfully:
```bash
npm run build
# Build successful - no more "Module not found" errors
```

## Files Using Cloudinary
The following files were using the Cloudinary package:

1. **Single Image Upload API** (`/src/app/api/admin/upload/route.js`)
   - Handles individual image uploads to Cloudinary
   - Returns Cloudinary URLs for storage in database

2. **Multiple Image Upload API** (`/src/app/api/admin/upload/multiple/route.js`)
   - Handles batch image uploads to Cloudinary
   - Returns array of Cloudinary URLs

3. **Cloudinary Utility Library** (`/src/lib/cloudinary.js`)
   - Helper functions for Cloudinary operations
   - Image deletion, URL transformation, public ID extraction

## Package Details
- **Package**: `cloudinary`
- **Version**: 2.7.0 (latest at time of installation)
- **Purpose**: Official Cloudinary SDK for Node.js
- **Usage**: Server-side image management

## Build Status

## Prevention
To avoid this issue in the future:
1. Always check that required packages are in `package.json`
2. Run `npm install` after cloning or when adding new dependencies
3. Include dependency installation in deployment scripts

## Testing
After the fix:
1. ✅ Production build succeeds
2. ✅ Cloudinary upload functionality works
3. ✅ Image deletion functionality works
