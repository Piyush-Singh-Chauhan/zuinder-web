# Next.js Webpack Module Error Fix

## Problem
Runtime error when building/running the application:
```
Cannot find module './5611.js'
```

This is a webpack-related error that occurs when there are issues with the build cache or corrupted module references.

## Root Cause
The error was caused by corrupted webpack build files or cache, not by application code issues. This type of error commonly occurs when:
1. Build files become corrupted
2. Webpack cache contains invalid references
3. Node modules are in an inconsistent state
4. There are multiple package-lock.json files causing conflicts

## Solution
Applied a comprehensive clean and rebuild approach:

### Step 1: Clean Build Artifacts
```bash
rm -rf .next node_modules/.cache
```

### Step 2: Complete Dependency Reinstall
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Step 3: Rebuild Application
```bash
npm run build
```

## Files and Directories Affected
- `.next/` - Next.js build output directory
- `node_modules/` - Dependency packages
- `node_modules/.cache` - Build cache
- `package-lock.json` - Dependency lock file

## Verification
After the fix:
✅ Production build succeeds (`npm run build`)
✅ No more "Cannot find module" errors
✅ Application starts correctly
✅ All routes are accessible

## Error Analysis
The error changed from `./4586.js` to `./5611.js`, indicating that the issue was with webpack's module resolution rather than specific application code. This is a classic symptom of build cache corruption.

## Prevention
To avoid similar issues in the future:

1. **Regular Clean Builds**
   ```bash
   # Periodically clean build artifacts
   rm -rf .next
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Dependency Management**
   ```bash
   # When adding new packages, ensure clean install
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

3. **Workspace Configuration**
   The warning about multiple package-lock.json files suggests:
   - Keep only one package-lock.json in the project root
   - Remove conflicting lock files in parent directories

4. **Build Verification**
   Always test both development and production builds:
   ```bash
   npm run dev     # Development server
   npm run build   # Production build
   ```

## Related Issues Fixed
This fix also resolved:
- Service icon field mismatch (previous fix)
- Cloudinary package missing (previous fix)

## Testing
To verify the fix is working:
1. Run `npm run build` - should complete without errors
2. Start the application with `npm run dev`
3. Navigate to various pages including:
   - `/admin/services`
   - `/admin/blogs`
   - `/admin/portfolio`
4. Verify no console errors appear
5. Test image uploads and CRUD operations

## Next Steps
If the error reoccurs:
1. Run the clean and rebuild process again
2. Check for multiple package-lock.json files
3. Ensure consistent Node.js and npm versions
4. Consider using `npm ci` for cleaner installs in deployment
