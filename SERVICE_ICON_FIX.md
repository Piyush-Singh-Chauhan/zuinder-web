# Service Icon Field Fix

## Problem
Runtime error when building/running the application:
```
Cannot find module './4586.js'
```

This error was caused by a mismatch between the service model and the admin services page component.

## Root Cause
The service model was updated to remove the `icon` field and require an `image` field instead, but the admin services page was still trying to display `service.icon`, which no longer exists.

## Solution
Updated the admin services page (`/src/app/admin/services/page.jsx`) to:
1. Remove references to `service.icon`
2. Display `service.image` instead
3. Add proper image handling with error fallback

## Changes Made

### Before (causing error):
```jsx
<div className="flex-shrink-0">
  <div className="h-10 w-10 flex items-center justify-center text-2xl">
    {service.icon}
  </div>
</div>
```

### After (fixed):
```jsx
<div className="flex-shrink-0">
  {service.image && (
    <img 
      src={service.image} 
      alt={service.title?.en || "Service"}
      className="h-10 w-10 object-cover rounded"
      onError={(e) => { e.target.style.display = 'none'; }}
    />
  )}
</div>
```

## Files Updated
- `/src/app/admin/services/page.jsx` - Removed icon references, added image display

## Verification
After the fix:
✅ Production build succeeds (`npm run build`)
✅ Admin services page loads without errors
✅ Service images display correctly
✅ No more "Cannot find module" errors

## Related Changes
This fix aligns with previous updates:
- Service schema modification (removed `icon` field, made `image` required)
- Service image handling (prioritize backend data over static fallback)
- Full CRUD operations for services

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Run `npm run build` - should complete successfully
2. Start the application with `npm run dev`
3. Navigate to `/admin/services`
4. Verify services display with images instead of icons
5. Check that no console errors appear

## Prevention
To avoid similar issues in the future:
1. When modifying data models, update all related components
2. Run build process after major changes to catch errors early
3. Use search tools to find all references to modified fields
4. Test both development and production builds
